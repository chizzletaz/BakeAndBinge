<p>Like many others, I've always loved baking and cooking. Over the years you try out new recipes and share the result with your family and friends.
    When the recipe is a hit you often you get the question: 'Can I get the recipe?'.
    Usually you scribble the recipe down on a piece of paper. You collect them and put them on a pile.
    I have a lot of those papers lying in the kitchen as well and I also lost some of the recipes, because I lost the piece of paper.  
    So wouldn't it would be much easier to add your recipe online and share it that way? No more scribbling, no more loose papers!
    That way you can bake good recipes and binge them at the same time!</p>
